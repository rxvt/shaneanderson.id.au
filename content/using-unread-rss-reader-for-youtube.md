Summary: Breaking my YouTube addiction by using an RSS reader.

I've been struggling with my YouTube addiction for a fair while now. I try to only use the Subscriptions view to limit myself to the latest videos from the channels I'm subscribed to but inevitably I get pulled down the algorithm rabbit hole and waste hours watching random videos. I've considered dropping YouTube altogether but there is so much great content on there that I don't want to miss out on, luckily I've found a better way.

I've been using the [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) RSS reader for a while now on my MacBook and iPhone and it's a great piece of software, but I recently discovered you can also use it to subscribe to YouTube channels in addition to RSS feeds! After adding my YouTube subscriptions it's definitely become my favourite way to consume YouTube content, and by default I only see a short text description of the video and there's no algorithm trying to cram more videos down my throat - it's great!
